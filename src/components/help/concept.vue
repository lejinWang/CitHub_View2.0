      <p>
        The <strong>CitHub</strong> project is launched in 2019 with the goal to improve the ability of using and
        studying the popular <strong>Combinatorial Interaction Testing (CIT)</strong> technique. Our intention here is
        not to design
        a “perfect” testing tool that meets all testers’ requirements (which is unrealistic due to the rapidly changing
        and conflicting real-world test environments), but to establish a software ecosystem of testing tools where any
        people can participate and benefit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>CitHub</strong> also combines the power of service-oriented architecture and crowdsourcing technologies.
        Specifically, each service is realised as a network accessible microservices. This provides an easy and uniform
        way to use testing tools (no need to download, install and configure), and also enables agile, dynamic, and
        flexible customisation and creation of testing tools. The crowdsourcing model further aggregate distributed
        knowledge, to effectively handle problems encountered during the developments of testing tools and applications
        of CIT.
      </p>

      <p>
        The key promise of <strong>CitHub</strong> is that it creates an open and innovative environment. This represents
        the exploitation of collective intelligence, and also a paradigm shift in developing and using testing tools. We
        hope and believe that CitHub could be a useful platform for any individual who wishes to use or study CIT, and
        also be a practice that others can extend and explore in different domains of software development.
